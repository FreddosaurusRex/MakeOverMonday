# MakeOverMonday
a Repo for Data Analysis via Code

## I am not an Expert, this is for learning and Sharing. please have fun. fork. code. practice. 

to use this you'll need:
- Python3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn 0.9.0
- numpy 
- Jupyter Notebooks

I really like to use VS Code, and with the AI extension you can run jupter notebooks directly in your IDE. 
You can also use Anaconda, and it will take care of most of the necessary packages. 

feel free to open any issues if you have comments, suggestions, or questions. 
i'd prefer you to fork this and then play with it on your own. i don't think i'll be doing PRs for this if you do any changes
as it's meant for a learning experience. i don't want to misrepresent myself with other's work. :)
